# Contributing to Local Journal

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Local Journal! This project is currently a design concept, so contributions are focused on documentation, design feedback, and architectural discussions.

## How to Contribute

### Design Feedback

We welcome feedback on the project's design and architecture. You can contribute by:

1. **Opening an Issue** - Share your thoughts on the current design documents
2. **Starting a Discussion** - Propose improvements to the architecture or feature set
3. **Reviewing Documentation** - Help identify gaps or unclear sections in our planning documents

### Documentation Improvements

If you find errors, unclear explanations, or areas that could be improved in our documentation:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b docs/your-improvement`)
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your improvements

### Code Contributions (Future)

When implementation begins, we will update these guidelines with specific coding standards, testing requirements, and contribution workflows.

## Guidelines

### Communication

- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions
- Focus on the idea, not the person
- Assume good intent from other contributors

### Issues

When opening an issue, please:

- Use a clear, descriptive title
- Provide as much context as possible
- For design feedback, reference specific sections of the documentation
- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates

### Pull Requests

For documentation changes:

- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Use clear commit messages
- Reference any related issues
- Ensure your changes don't break document links or formatting
