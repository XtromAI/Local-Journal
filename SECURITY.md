# Security Policy

## Project Status

Local Journal is currently a **design concept and portfolio item** with no executable code implemented. This security policy outlines our commitment to security principles in the design phase and will be updated as implementation progresses.

## Security by Design

Local Journal is designed with privacy and security as core principles:

### Privacy-First Architecture

- **Local-Only Data Storage**: All personal data remains on the user's device
- **No Cloud Storage**: Zero personal data transmitted to external servers
- **No User Accounts**: No sign-up, authentication, or cloud accounts required
- **Data Ownership**: Users maintain complete control over their data

### Planned Security Features

- **Encrypted Local Database**: Isar database with encryption for sensitive data
- **Secure API Key Storage**: Flutter Secure Storage for API key management
- **Minimal Data Transmission**: Only AI prompts sent to Gemini API (no personal journal content in identifiable form)

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |

## Security Updates

As implementation begins, this policy will be updated to include:

- Dependency vulnerability management
- Security testing procedures
- Incident response procedures
- Version support timelines
